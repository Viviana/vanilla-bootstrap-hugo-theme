## Overview of Class Design 

This class will have a combination of asynchronous lectures and synchronous discussion and R simulations which will be pre-recorded. In the synchronous session, we will tentatively meet every Thursday at 5:30 pm to do a quick overview of lectures, work through R and review lab assignments in real time. There will be weekly lab assignments. Students will partner up and work on a data analysis project throughout the semester. Methods covered in this course include exploratory data analysis, correlation and bivariate analysis, linear regression, panel data regression, and probit/logistic regression. Collective and reflective learning will be the key cornerstone for excelling in this class! 

**Special Note about Learning in a Pandemic** 

>I am committed to ensuring your successful learning in this class. Please talk to me and ask questions during or after class time. I commit to being thoughtful and empathetic towards each of you as you navigate the current circumstances and your personal situations. I will also be open, fair, professional, and passionate in teaching this class. In turn, I ask that you exercise the same consideration and compassion towards your classmates, TAs and GAs, UMass Amherst staff, and your professors. We are all moving through this differently, but together.

**Required Software** 

*Installing R & R Studio* 

You will need to install R (the free and open source statistical computing language used in this course) and R Studio (the graphical user interface for R) in advance before the first class.  

*	Install [R software](https://cran.rstudio.com/)  
*	Install [R Studio Desktop](https://cran.rstudio.com/)  
*	Join the class space on R Studio Cloud [Invited Only]  

There are infinitely many new packages available for us to use. It is highly recommended to use the free RStudio, an interface for writing R documents and working with data. For this class, you will have access to RStudio Cloud where you can use R online anywhere throughout the semester. 

You will also use R Studio Desktop/Cloud to work on your assignment, you will use R Markdown to “knit” your assignment/quiz submission in .docx or .pdf format. All files named: Last name_HW1, e.g., Wu_HW1. More instructions will follow in the first few labs.
